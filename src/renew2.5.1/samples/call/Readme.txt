This directory contains the example nets and net stub classes presented in
the "Renew User Guide", Section "Calling Nets from Java".

Before you can run the examples, you need to compile the Java classes.
Please follow the instructions in the User Guide (same Section as above).
In most cases, the command 'jcompile' will do the trick.

The stub classes declare that they belong to the package 'samples.call'.
When running the examples in Renew, take care to point the classpath to the
directory above 'samples' (in the usual distribution layout, this is the
'renewx.y' installation directory).

For your convenience, the generated Java code of the stub classes is
already provided.  So there is no need to run the 'compilestub' command.
If you want to regenerate the net stub codeÂ«, please follow the
instructions in the User Guide (again the same Section).
