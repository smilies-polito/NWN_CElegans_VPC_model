This directory (bin/unix/freedesktop) provides configuration files for
FreeDesktop-compliant user interfaces like Gnome.  The files establish
several mime types for Renew drawings and provide a launcher to be
integrated into menus or the desktop.

The files are provided without any warranty.

The files have been created by an ambitious user within the Gnome 2.14
desktop.

Installation of these files has to be done according to the guidelines from
the Gnome System administration guide, Sections "Desktop Files" and "Mime
Types". The installdesktop script provided with the Renew release carries out
a user-local installation of desktop icons and file type associations. This 
feature is tested in the most common desktop environments, but may not work
properly for some system configurations.

For those cases, in which a manual installation is required, the basic steps 
are listed here for your convenience, but without warranty as is the 
installdesktop script:

1. The pre-configured desktop configuration file Renew.desktop can be 
  installed with the desktop-file-install tool from the desktop-file-utils
  package.
  # desktop-file-install --dir=/usr/share/applications/ Renew.desktop
  or
  % desktop-file-install --dir=~/.local/share/applications/ Renew.desktop

  Probably the line starting with "Exec=" in the Renew.desktop file has to
  be edited to include the full path to the renew application start script
  in the uplevel directory (bin/unix).

2. Copy the file renew.xml to the packages folder of your MIME database.
  For a system-wide installation, this might be either
  /usr/local/share/mime/packages or /usr/share/mime/packages,
  for a user-local installation, this is probably
  ~/.local/share/mime/packages.
  Then initiate an update of the mime database, for example
  # update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
  or
  % update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime

3. To register Renew as the default application for Renew associated
y  mime types, you can use the xdg-mime tool from the xdg-utils package.
  e.g. % xdg-mime default Renew.desktop application/x-renew-net.
  Continue this step for all file types you wish to associate with Renew.
  
4. You can install icon files for the Renew file types which are provided
  with the distribution in various sizes. All icon image files can be found
  in the bin/unix/fredesktop/icons subfolder. They can be installed with
  the xdg-icon-resource tool. The tool requires the size of the icon as a
  parameter. 
  e.g. % xdg-icon-resource install --size 48 
       	 		   icons/48x48/mimetypes/application-x-renew-net.png
  Continue this step according to the file type associations configured above.
  Do not forget the Renew application icon.
  % xdg-icon-resource install --novendor 48 icons/48x48/apps/renew.png

The previous steps make Renew drawing files known to the file manager and 
integrate the Renew application to the application launch menu. This allows 
you to open drawing files in the Renew application by double clicking the 
file in the file manager. However, each drawing file will be opened in an 
individual Renew instance.
You can configure Renew to open all drawings in one Renew instance by assigning
an open port to the de.renew.loadServerPort property to the configuration file
(refer to the Renew manual for details).
