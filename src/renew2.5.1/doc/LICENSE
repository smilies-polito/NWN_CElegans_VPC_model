Renew - The Reference Net Workshop
==================================

Renew is a high-level Petri net simulator written in Java.
This file tells you about license terms and disclaimer.

    
License
=======

`We' refers to the copyright holders. `You' refers to the licensee.
`Renew' refers to the complete set of sources, executables,
and sample nets that make up the Reference Net Workshop.

Renew is available free of charge, but not without restrictions.
The majority of Renew is published under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (for details see Section ``Original Parts'' below).
However, Renew builds up on other people's work that has been licensed
under other terms.

The license section got a bit long. We apologize, but we cannot hope
to do better, because we included many external parts with many
different licenses.


Contributed Parts
-----------------

Renew uses several parts that were previously developed by other 
people and have been made publicly available.


The collections
...............

The collections package is used as our set/queue/list
implementation. The relevant license information states:

  Originally written by Doug Lea and released into the public domain. 

You can use it as you want. Please note that Doug Lea now suggests to
use the container libraries that come with Java~1.2 instead of his own 
libraries. 
We are currently working on the migration, so far all plug-ins
except the FS plug-in have been adopted to the Java container classes.


The JHotDraw
............

The JHotDraw graphical editor written by Erich Gamma is 
copyrighted. The relevant license information states:

  JHotDraw is copyright 1996, 1997 by IFA Informatik and Erich Gamma.

  It is hereby granted that this software can be used, copied, modified, 
  and distributed without fee provided that this copyright notice appears 
  in all copies.


Code Generated from JavaCC
..........................

Some of the code of Renew was generated by the parser generator
JavaCC. The relevant license information states:

  3. DEVELOPED PRODUCTS

  You may use the Software to generate software program(s) ("Developed
  Programs").  Sun claims no rights in or to the Developed Programs.

  4. YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OF SAMPLE GRAMMARS

  DERIVATIVES AND DEVELOPED PRODUCTS

  You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Sun from and against
  any claims or suits, including attorneys' fees, which arise or result
  from any use or distribution of Sample Grammar Derivatives and/or
  Developed Programs.

Hence we would like to explicitly point out that Sun is not responsible
for any problems that might result from the use of the output of JavaCC.


Bill's Java Grammar
...................

A Java grammar billsJava1.0.2.jj was distributed together with 
JavaCC 0.7 as a sample grammar. Bill McKeeman (mckeeman@mathworks.com)
contributed this grammar to JavaCC. The relevant license information 
from Sun states:

  2. SAMPLE GRAMMARS

  You may modify the sample grammars included in the Software to develop
  derivatives thereof ("Sample Grammar Derivatives"), and sublicense the
  Sample Grammar Derivatives directly or indirectly to your customers.

  4. YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OF SAMPLE GRAMMARS

  DERIVATIVES AND DEVELOPED PRODUCTS

  You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Sun from and against
  any claims or suits, including attorneys' fees, which arise or result
  from any use or distribution of Sample Grammar Derivatives and/or
  Developed Programs.

The original parts of billsJava1.0.2.jj which are now contained 
in a modified form in the files JavaNetParser.jj, FSNetParser.jj, 
FSParser.jj, and StubParser.jj are Copyright (C) 1996, 1997
Sun Microsystems Inc. A sublicense for these grammars is hereby granted. 
If you have any further questions, please consult the file COPYRIGHT 
as distributed with JavaCC.


Graph Layout Algorithm
......................

The graph layout algorithm used in the class de.renew.util.GraphLayout
was originally provided by Sun as part of the Java Development Kit.
The relevant license information from Sun states:

We would like to explicitly point out that Sun is not responsible
for any problems that might result from the use of the graph layout 
algorithm. See the source files for Sun's original disclaimer.

Renew comes with a slightly modified version of Java libraries
provided by the the FreeHEP project to support several export formats
like EPS, PDF, SVG or PNG.  The FreeHEP libraries are provided under
the same license as Renew itself (the GNU Lesser General Public
License, for a link see below) which allows the inclusion of a binary
distribution within other projects.  The modified sources are
available at https://github.com/renew-tgi/.


JLine2
......

Renew comes with an unmodified, binary distribution and some slightly
modified classes of the JLine2 package, which provides the
basis for the Console plug-in.  JLine2 is distributed under
the BSD License, meaning that you are completely free to redistribute,
modify, or sell it with almost no restrictions.  The full license is
included in the distribution, a copy of the License may also be
obtained from https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php.

The original JLine2 package can be obtained from
https://github.com/jline/jline2/, the modified classes are part
of the source distribution of Renew.


Commons CLI
...........

Commons CLI is a library that supports parsing command line commands
in Java and is distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 as of
2004. It is used by Renew to provide a uniform command line interface. 
The Commons CLI library is available at the Apache project website 
http://commons.apache.org/cli.


Other Libraries
...............

sec:other-libraries

Other libraries might provide their own licenses. 


Original Parts
--------------

This copyright section deals with those part of Renew that are not
based on other works, i.e. the example nets and the packages
fs and de.renew without the JavaCC grammars.


Example Nets
............

The example nets are in the public domain. You may modify them as
you like. You may use them as the basis for your own nets without
restrictions.


Java Source Code and Executables
................................

Sources and executables are copyright 1998-- by Olaf
Kummer, Frank Wienberg, Michael Duvigenau, Lawrence Cabac, Michael
Haustermann, David Mosteller and others.  You can distribute these
files under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
along with this program in the file doc/COPYING; if not, write to
the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,
MA 02111-1307 USA.


Created Parts
-------------

You are permitted to use works that you create with Renew (i.e., Java
stubs, net drawings, EPS/PDF output, simulation states, and other
exported data) without restrictions.


Disclaimer
----------

We distribute Renew in the hope that it will be useful, but without 
any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or 
fitness for a particular purpose.

We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or 
consequential damage including, but not limited to, loss of data, loss 
of profits, or system failure, which arises out of use or inability to
use Renew or works created with Renew. This clause does not apply to 
gross negligence or premeditation.

Some parts of Renew may use patented techniques that may not be freely 
usable in some countries. In that case, it is the responsibility of the 
user of Renew to obtain a license on the aforementioned techniques 
before using Renew.

Some parts of Renew may include additional disclaimers in their license 
terms. In such cases, both disclaimers hold simultaneously. If one
clause of any disclaimer is found invalid under applicable law, this 
does not affect the validity of the remaining clauses or of other 
disclaimers.

The applicable court is Hamburg, Germany.

-----------

This license is intended to be Open Source compliant. 

If you find any clause within this license that is incompatible with 
the guidelines set forth in the Open Source definition (see 
http://www.opensource.org/osd.html), please contact the authors.
